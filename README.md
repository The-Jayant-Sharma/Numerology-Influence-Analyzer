# Numerology-Influence-Analyzer
This software uses an algorithm to display the energies behind each number, neumerologically. And how much in percent, they affect the major number.

## Markdown-Format
If you want to investigate a number in the form ``ABCD-EFGH`` consider using the format ``<(A, B, C, D)(E, F, G, H)>``.
Multiple Inputs can be given, and as result the system will provide individual as well as a average A
analysis. 

## Modes of system
The system is equipped with three modes, the *Reversed Mode* gives weightage to the numbers that appear in the raw digits rather than the core number. 
The *Normal Mode* gives more Weightage to the core reduced number. 
The *Neutral Mode* gives no weightage. 

Though, ut is ovserved that in most of the cases, the order remains mostly the same in all three modes, still a numerologist is supposed to investigate the number under all three modes.
